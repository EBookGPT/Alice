# Chapter One: Introduction to Alice

Welcome to the first chapter of our textbook on Alice! Alice, as most of you know, is a popular programming language used to create 3D animations, interactive applications, and video games. It was developed at Carnegie Mellon University as a successor to the language called "Object-Oriented Petri Nets." 

Alice is a programming language that is easy to learn, fun to use, and it empowers users to create their own 3D worlds. Alice was designed with the intent to expose young people (in particular, women) to computer programming as a creative and artistic tool. 

In this chapter, we will provide an overview of Alice and its many applications in real-world scenarios. We'll also discuss the basic concepts that you'll need to know before you start writing Alice code. 

As we delve deeper into Alice, we'll solve a mystery with the help of none other than Sherlock Holmes. You'll see how Alice can be used to aid in crime solving, as we explore a case involving a stolen artifact. With each chapter, the Alice code used to solve the mystery will become more intricate, and so too will your understanding of the programming language.

So sit back, grab a cup of tea, and let's begin our journey into the fascinating world of Alice!
# Chapter One: Introduction to Alice - The Case of the Stolen Artifact

Sherlock Holmes was on a particularly dull sabbatical when he received an unexpected letter from an old friend. The letter contained details of a robbery that had taken place at the British Museum in the early hours of the morning. The stolen artifact was a priceless Egyptian relic that was supposed to go on display the following week. 

As always, Holmes was intrigued. He immediately set to work and asked Dr. Watson to accompany him to the museum to examine the crime scene. Upon arriving, they spoke to the security guard on duty, who had been incapacitated during the robbery. 

After inspecting the scene, Holmes turned his attention to the security footage. Surprisingly, the footage had been partially corrupted, making it difficult to identify the culprits. Holmes knew he would have to rely on his intuition and a little bit of help from the world of Alice programming. 

He started by analyzing the footage and came up with a plan. He would use Alice's 3D animation capabilities to create a replica of the museum interior and recreate the events surrounding the robbery. Holmes would then use the code to explore every possible angle of the crime and uncover any clues that may have been overlooked. 

With the help of Alice, Holmes began building a 3D model of the museum. He recreated every detail, from the ceiling to the floor tiles, and even the position of the security guards. Holmes plugged in the data from the footage until he had a seamless, virtual replica of the museum. 

Next, Holmes created a program that would allow him to simulate different theories of the case. He built a model of the Egyptian room in the museum and, using Alice, he was able to move replicas of the artifacts, guards, and robbers within the space. 

As he tested his theories, one scenario caught his eye. It appeared that the security guard on duty had left his post to take a smoke break just a few minutes before the robbery. Holmes deduced that the robbers had likely observed the security guard and planned the heist accordingly. 

The simulation allowed Holmes to identify the two robbers as they made their way to the museum. With this new information, combined with traditional detective work, Holmes was able to solve the case and recover the stolen artifact. 

In subsequent chapters, we'll show you how to use Alice to create virtual models of crime scenes, explore evidence from different angles, and identify suspects in complex criminal cases. Get ready to join the world of virtual crime solving with Alice!
# Chapter One: Introduction to Alice - Resolving the Case with Code

In our Sherlock Holmes-inspired mystery, we saw how Alice's 3D animation capabilities allowed Holmes to recreate the interior of the museum and animate possible scenarios surrounding the robbery. In this section, we'll delve deeper into the code behind the simulation and provide an overview of the technical concepts used.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

One of the key concepts in Alice programming is object-oriented programming, which allows programmers to create modular code and organize large systems into smaller, manageable pieces. Each object in Alice has attributes and behaviors, just like objects in the real world. 

For example, in our Sherlock Holmes mystery, each character, artifact, and room in the museum was considered an object, with specific attributes and behaviors that can be modified.

## 3D Models

Alice's 3D animation capabilities allow for the creation of custom models that can be imported into the environment. In our Sherlock Holmes mystery, Holmes created a 3D model of the museum and placed replicas of the characters, artifacts, and other elements into the space.

These models were created using Alice's built-in modeling tools, which allow for the creation and editing of 3D shapes such as spheres, cones, and cylinders. Every object in Alice has the ability to be manipulated, hidden, or repositioned within the 3D environment, making it easy to create scenarios and play around with different hypotheses.

## Animation

Animation is another key concept in Alice programming, as it allows characters and objects to move and interact with each other. In our mystery, we used Alice's animation capabilities to simulate the movements of the robbers and the security guard, as well as the artifacts and other elements within the scene.

Animations in Alice are created using a timeline interface, which allows programmers to specify the position, orientation, and motion of objects at different points in time. These animations can be played back and modified in real-time, making it easy to iterate and refine the simulation until the desired results are achieved.

In conclusion, the code used to solve the Sherlock Holmes mystery involved the creation of custom 3D models in Alice, animation of these models, and the use of object-oriented programming concepts to simulate different theories of the crime. By leveraging these powerful features of Alice, Holmes was able to catch the culprits and recover the stolen artifact!
